# Hey, I'm Mohamed Hamdy!


### I'm a WordPress developer!

I graduated from the faculty of engineering - computer and systems discipline in 2010!
I worked as a telecom Engineer, and I had a lot of stories there, some were sad and most were happy.
I worked in multinational companies for great clients.
But from 3 years I decided to follow my old passion and back to programming.
I took some time to find the suitable branch for me, and I took my time.
And now is the time to start a new journey as a freelancer WordPress developer.
